  * This is a re-implementation  of the contrast measure as proposed in HiCS
  * Use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as basis. To the best of my knowledge, the most efficient existing implementation.

  * @alpha Expected share of instances in slice (independent dimensions).
  * @beta  Expected share of instances in marginal restriction (reference dimension).
  *        Added with respect to the original paper to loose the dependence of beta from alpha.
